   <h1>Walking a dog</h1>
   <h2>To begin, obtain the following items</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>a leash</li>
       <li>a plastic bag</li>
         <li>a dog (doesn't have to be yours)</li>
         <li> a treat (mainly for the dog, but feel free to treat yourself also)</li>
         </ul>

  <p> First take the leash and carefully attach it to the dog's collar without hurting the dog. Keep a firm hold on the leash at all times. Keep the plastic bag with you also, in case the dog has to use the bathroom while on your walk. Proceed onto your designated walking route, always holding the leash. When you return home, make sure to reward the dog with a treat to let him know he did a good job on the walk. You can also treat yourself for giving the dog a walk and being a good owner.</p>
